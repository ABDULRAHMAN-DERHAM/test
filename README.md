##  B. ABSTRACT 
In this PROJECT we are going to learn how to detect text in images. We will learn how to detect individual characters and words and how to place bounding boxes around them. We will also look at how to detect only digits.

Figure 1 shows the AI output of detecting which user is not wearing a face mask or inappropriate face mask.


## C.  DATASET





## G.   PROJECT PRESENTATION 

In this project, you learned how to create a Text Detection with OpenCV , Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.







Our face mask detector is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, itâ€™s also computationally efficient, making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, Jetosn, Nano, etc.).
